## Creation Process  
  
### **1. Strategy**  

- The organisation requires ad easy-to-read, dependable website that delivers clear information that allows for children to be able to understand how to play the quizzes.
- Links to social media sites should be available.
- The site will be optimised for tablet but should still be resposive amongst all screen sizes.
- The site must have a child friendly and engaging palette and should be age appropriate.
 - User engagement is an essential feature required for this website.
  
### **2. Scope**  

The Truthy or Falsey site must be available on a wide range of devices in order to support user activity. The main target audience is young children but adults should also be able to use in case the target audience needs early direction. Once initial direction has been demonstrated then it is expected that returning users should be able to navigate with ease. 
- The site is to contain quizzes that supplement educational requirements.
- Text must be clear and legible on any sized device and adhere to accessibility guidelines. 
- A guide to how to use the site will be available in the About section.
- For future development we should look at SEN needs and how changes to the website can be made to meet these criteria.
  
### **3. Structural**  

The design and layout of the website should be simple, functional and accessible. Users should be able to understand what the site is about from the landing page and quickly navigate to the desired page through a navigation menu. 
- Easy to identify, clickable links with a consistent layout. The design is to be predictable and aligned with current trends.
- Any buttons or links had to provide feedback to the user to identify their purpose in the form of a design change that followed the flow of the overall aesthetic.   

### **4. Skeleton**  

The site has been developed to be simple, clear, engaging, and familiar
- For the landing page the navigation menu should be evident in the top right of the screen with the home navigation button in the top left. The supporting header underneath will contain the site brand.
- Further navigation links will be provided in the landing page through clicking on animals.
- A large, clear image dominates the background with a view of a woodland.
- The landing page will be supported by an aboy page accessed through the menu.
- The page ends with the footer containing brand copyright. Social media links will be available on the About page.

### **5. Surface**  

 A design was created so that on initial landing children would direct to the main body containing clickable links hideen behind animal images whilst adults would be drawn intuitively to the navigation menu at the head of the page.
 - A background image was used to supoprt engagement from the target market for the site.
 - The pallete is bright yet soft in line with modern standards.

Overall, the design was intended to engage children directly through the use of a wonderland woodland scene whilst Adults could engage the site through the use of the navigation menu as per industry standards

## Design  

### **Color Scheme**  

The website uses a pallette of bright contempory pastels that align with colours used in contempory childrens media and literature. The belief is that this will provide a familiarity to the target audience and allow them to engage with ease.

![Color schem](docs/documentation/color-pallete.png)
  
### **Typography**  

  [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import Manrope and because it is a similar font to others used in Childrens promotional material and as such will add familiarity.

  ![google Fonts type used](docs/documentation/google-fonts-manrope.png)
        
### **Imagery**  

  The imagery used across the main landing page and quiz pages is intended to draw in the user in an imaginary woodland scene. In line with a lot of childrens literature woodland scnes are ofthen depicted as a place of magic and wonder that allows the imagination to thrive.

### **Footer**

<summary></summary>

![screenshot of footer](docs/documentation/)
</details>
The footer contains clickable links to social media sites and is consistent across all screen sizes. These links will only be avaible on the about page as we feel that it is inapprpriate for children to mistakenly click links that direct the user to external sites.

## Tablet & Mobile View  
 
### **Desktop, Tablet & Mobile Differences**  
  
To ensure responsivity we used flexbox in the CSS styling and Bootstrap for the header and navigation elements to ensure that content is aligned. The site is optimised for tablet but still responds across all screen sizes.
  
### **Mobile View (iPhone SE)**
